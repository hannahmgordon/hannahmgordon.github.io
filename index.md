## About Me


My name is Hanah Gordon, and I am currently a rising senior studying Financial Engineering in Lehigh University's IBE Honors Program. The purpose of this website is to showcase coding work I have done on my own and in classes, particularly FIN377 (Applied Data Analytics for Finance in Python).

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](report/report.md)**_

This project examines the relationship between sentiment in 10-K filings and stock returns around the publication date. I constructed three sentiment dictionaries focused on employees, innovation, and reputation which I measured alongside an existing dictionary of positive and negative words. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms, I extracted and cleaned text from 10-K reports, computed 10 sentiment scores, and analyzed their correlation with stock returns. The report above describes and analyzes my findings.
