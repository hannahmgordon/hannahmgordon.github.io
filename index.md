## About Me

My name is Hanah Gordon, and I am currently a rising senior studying Financial Engineering in Lehigh University's IBE Honors Program. The purpose of this website is to showcase coding work I have done on my own and in classes, particularly FIN377 (Applied Data Analytics for Finance in Python).

## Portfolio

    <img src="pics/midterm.png" alt="10-Ks Project Thumbnail" />
    <p>This project examines the relationship between sentiment in 10-K filings and stock returns around the publication date. I constructed three sentiment dictionaries focused on employees, innovation, and reputation, and measured them alongside an existing dictionary of positive and negative words. I then analyzed their correlation with returns using data from the S&P 500.</p>
