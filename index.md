## About Me

My name is Hanah Gordon, and I am currently a rising senior studying Financial Engineering in Lehigh University's IBE Honors Program. The purpose of this website is to help you learn a little bit about me, my career objectives, my hobbies, and to showcase projects that I have done on my own and in classes, particularly FIN377 (Applied Data Analytics for Finance in Python) and IBE050 (IBE Workshop).

## Portfolio

<div class="card">
  <h3><a href="report/report.html">Sentiment in 10-K Filings and Stock Returns: A Textual Analysis of the S&P 500</a></h3>
  <p>This project examines the relationship between sentiment in 10-K filings and stock returns around the publication date. I constructed three sentiment dictionaries focused on employees, innovation, and reputation, and measured them alongside an existing dictionary of positive and negative words. I then analyzed their correlation with returns using data from the S&P 500.</p>

<div class="card">
  <h3><a href="https://lazypricesreplication.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">The Predictive Power of 10-K Similarity on Future Returns</a></h3>
  <p>This dashboard explores the relationship between changes in the language of 10-K filings year-over-year and subsequent stock returns. I worked in a group of four to create various interactive visualizations of our data and write a report to explain our findings and help our users understand the relationship between 10-K changes and stock returns.</p>

  <h3><a href="pics/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">IBE Workshop Entrepreneurship Final Project</a></h3>
  <p>In the IBE Workshop course my group and I were tasked with creating a product that solved a real-world problem. We did extensive market research, speaking to parents, pediatricians, and patients, in order to develop a realistic and desirable product solution. At the end of the semester we presented our product, Booster Buddy, in an hour long presentation competition to parents and professors and achieved second place. The process that this project followed was a miniature version of my IBE Senior Capstone, which I am currently working on and excited to showcase! </p>

## Career Objectives

I am interested in pursuing a career in finance that allows me to utilize my quantitative, financial, and interpersonal skills. My IBE education coupled with the various leadership roles I have held during my time at Lehigh has given me a well-rounded skill set and shown me how fullfilling it can be to bring my various skills together for one objective. Additionally, I have an affinity for entrepreneurship, which I hope to pursue further one day. During the summer of 2025, I will be working at PwC as a Financial Transformations Consulting Intern in NYC. I am excited to explore this career path and possibly others on my journey toward finding where my skill set can be best utilized!

## Hobbies

My hobbies bring me a lot of fulfillment outside of my academics. I love playing tennis and am on the Lehigh Club Tennis Team. I also enjoy crafts of all sorts but spend the most time sewing, crocheting, and working on DIY projects. A few of my other favorite ways to spend my time include traveling, Jewish involvement and education, spending time with family and friends, and going for walks.
