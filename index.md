## About Me

## Portfolio

<div class="card">
  <h3><a href="report/report.html">Sentiment in 10-K Filings and Stock Returns: A Textual Analysis of the S&P 500</a></h3>
  <p>This project examines the relationship between sentiment in 10-K filings and stock returns around the publication date. I constructed three sentiment dictionaries focused on employees, innovation, and reputation, and measured them alongside an existing dictionary of positive and negative words. I then analyzed their correlation with returns using data from the S&P 500.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://lazypricesreplication.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">The Predictive Power of 10-K Similarity on Future Returns</a></h3>
  <p>This dashboard explores the relationship between changes in the language of 10-K filings year over year and subsequent stock returns. We have created various visualizations of our data to help our users understand this relationship and a report to explain our findings.</p>

  <h3><a href="pics/Poster.pdf">IBE Workshop Entrepreneurship Final Project</a></h3>
  <p>In my IBE workshop class my group and I were tasked with creating a product that solved a real-world problem. We did extensive market research, speaking to parents, pediatricians, and patients, in order to develop a realistic and desirable product solution. At the end of the semester we presented our product, Booster Buddy, in an hour long presentation to parents and professors and achieved second place. </p>
